# Beautiful icons for OpenWeatherMap API

Listed icons I found from Figma community. I found matching icons for my app.

Thanks authors for sharing their work.

## Customize / optimize icons
I shared icons in ico/3d and use <WeatherIcon> component to display them.

All icons are in PNG format.

If you need some optimization or other sizes - visit link https://www.figma.com/design/O3wSw0L8ZkIRSYAkWvShMY/weather-%2F-widget?node-id=3-437&t=JGChAoTlbyOHyV7u-1 and clone this project.
After cloning, you can setup exports and export icons in SVG format and convert them to PNG.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
